## 💬 About

This website reflects my approach to frontend — clean code, usability, and attention to design.  
Each component was written with scalability and simplicity in mind, ensuring readability and maintainability.

I built it not just as a portfolio, but as a statement of who I am as a developer —  
**structured, curious, and always improving.**
